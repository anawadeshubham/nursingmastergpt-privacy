    <h1>Nursing MasterGPT — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="small">Last updated: 29 November 2025</p>

    <p>Nursing MasterGPT is an educational AI assistant built to help BSc Nursing students. This privacy policy explains how Google OAuth access is used for the application.</p>

    <h2>What access the app requests</h2>
    <p>The application requests <strong>read-only</strong> Google Drive access (scope: <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly</code>) so the app can read files in the developer’s specified Drive folder to generate study content and exam-ready answers. The app does not request write or delete permissions.</p>

    <h2>Data usage</h2>
    <p>The app uses OAuth solely to read files from the developer’s Google Drive folder. Files are used to produce study material, summaries, care plans, MCQs and other outputs in chat. No user personal information is collected, stored or shared.</p>

    <h2>Storage & retention</h2>
    <p>No user data is stored by any third party as part of this app. OAuth tokens are used only to perform Drive reads during an active session.</p>

    <h2>Revoking access</h2>
    <p>Users (including the developer) can revoke this app’s access anytime from their Google Account → Security → Third-party apps with account access.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>Developer contact: anawadeshubham@gmail.com</p>

    <p class="small">This page serves as the required privacy policy for Google OAuth compliance.</p>
